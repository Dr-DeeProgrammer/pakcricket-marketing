    <div class="section problem">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Many young and skilled cricketers go unnoticed because of poor access to talent platforms. 
           Existing apps are often complex, slow, or designed for professionals only.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section solution">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>PakCricket solves this by offering an easy, all-in-one mobile app for player profiles, 
           match updates, and talent discovery — designed specifically for local cricket communities.</p>
